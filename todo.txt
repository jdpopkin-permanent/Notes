Need comments on Notes. Need Votes (on songs, notes, and comments of all kinds).
Need sessions controller etc.

Note: if we're going to have a BFS for collaborations, we need to have
complicated relations between songs and artists (a link table).

Q: is there a way to avoid duplicating extremely similar models? For example:
vote model on songs, comments, notes. SEE RAILS GUIDES - POLYMORPHIC ASSOCIATIONS.

Fill out db:seeds.

Create index page.

Ask how partial Backbone works: you only have one application.js, so how can you
have meaningfully different javascript behavior on different pages of your site?
Maybe it's trivial but thus far our Backbone stuff have mostly involved a single
HTML page with Backbone doing everything.

Backbone with multiple routers? Do we simply initialize a different router on
each page?

Find a way to rate songs (either by votes or ideally by recent votes).
