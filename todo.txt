Need comments on Notes. Need Votes (on songs, notes, and comments of all kinds).
Need sessions controller etc.

Note: if we're going to have a BFS for collaborations, we need to have
complicated relations between songs and artists (a link table).

Q: is there a way to avoid duplicating extremely similar models? For example:
vote model on songs, comments, notes. SEE RAILS GUIDES - POLYMORPHIC ASSOCIATIONS.

Fill out db:seeds.

Ask how partial Backbone works: you only have one application.js, so how can you
have meaningfully different javascript behavior on different pages of your site?
Maybe it's trivial but thus far our Backbone stuff have mostly involved a single
HTML page with Backbone doing everything.

Backbone with multiple routers? Do we simply initialize a different router on
each page?

Find a way to rate songs (either by votes or ideally by recent votes).

Should the root use Backbone? Currently it only needs to show and hide the login
form.

Would it be possible to have a dropdown list of artists load dynamically as you type?

We should be able to deep link to particular albums, artists, and songs, so that
stuff should NOT be done via Backbone.

Short term stuff: write index and show pages for artists and albums. Add some capacity
to edit and update song, artist, and album pages.

Show pages for artist and album needed.
